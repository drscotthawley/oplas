Release repo for "Operational Latent Spaces"

Summary page: https://drscotthawley.github.io/oplas 

This isn't so much a "package" as it is a collection of notebooks for demonstrating the ideas in the paper. 

## Contents

In `nbs/`:
* `nbs/mixer-toy.ipynb`: demo of "Mixing in latent space"
* `nbs/co5ths_nd.pynb`: demo for learning 64-dimensional Circle of Fifths (includes)

Other files, e.g. `rot_2d.ipynb` and `rot_nd.ipynb` are precedents to the Circle of 5ths code. 

In `oplas/`: 
* various source codes to for later use in working with real audio. (Work in Progress)
